# Hey there! I'm Allan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a technologist fascinated by the "why" behind the "how." While many can build or fix technology, I thrive on understanding *why* people use it the way they do and how to make that experience better. This curiosity led me to pursue a Master's in Human-Computer Interaction from DePaul University, where I built a deep foundation in user-centric problem-solving, web architecture, and data analysis.

I've explored this intersection of people and technology from multiple angles. As a technical recruiter, I analyzed IT and engineering roles, learning firsthand what separates a good technical solution from a great one. In my hands-on IT support role I delivered Tier-1 support, deployed new hardware, and improved network infrastructure. This passion extends beyond my professional life, with years of experience designing and building custom PCs from the ground up.
